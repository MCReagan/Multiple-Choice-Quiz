# Multiple Choice Quiz

This application was created using JavaScript. The aim for this project was creating a self-contained application that updates content on the screen as you play. This has proven to be an ineffecient method in creating a game, but it was quite a fun challenge to work on. In the future, making several html pages containing the questions could prove beneficial.

## Installation

Installation is not required, however, there is a know bug that prevents the application from properly initializing. Until refactoring can fix the issue, the player must view the highscore page before beginning the game. Once the highscore page has been viewed, the game works with no issues.
